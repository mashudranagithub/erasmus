				<p>This Curriculum requires practical, real-world learning methodologies to develop the appropriate Transformative Competency-Based Public Health Education for Professional Employability in Bangladesh’s Health Sector/TRANS4M-PH competencies for respective public health fields. Learners must immerse themselves in community-based environments; to develop critical thinking, knowledge and understanding. This integral need for appropriate Public Health pedagogy requires formative steps of learning methodological design through a group of priority courses while concurrently developing local faculty capabilities.</p>

				<h4>Competency-based Faculty Facilitator Development</h4>

				<p>The success of this Competency-based Curriculum system rests with the Faculty, who must conceptualize, manage and improvise their courses to ensure concrete competency outcomes. It is critical that our Public Health Faculty cultivate their passion for teaching with the appropriate practical knowledge, field experience and creativity to train future public health professionals.</p>

				<p>Faculty capacity will be up skilled and grounded in Developing Country Public Health needs. Traditional faculty-centric teaching will thereby transition to learner-centric teaching, focusing on the learner’s priorities, real-world professional needs and skills development.</p>


				<h4>Faculty Professional Skills Training</h4>

				<p>To initiate the process of indigenizing this extensive educational know-how and practice, the 3 partners will collate the Three Curriculum components’ design and practical learnings, into structured, formalized Faculty Professional Skills Development Training modules. Thus enabling knowledge and practice continuity, institutional memory and a self-generating cycle of Faculty capacity building. This will institutionalize the complete Competency-Based Curriculum system and enable the participating Faculty to become competent local resources for their entire Faculty to access the project’s Curriculum Design learning, practice and professional improvement. These Competency-based Professional Training will pioneer a more rigorous self, peer, student and performance assessment system to develop teaching accountability and continual quality improvement.</p>

				<p>It is only when the core features of Competency-based Curriculum, Competency-based Learning Methodologies, Competency-based Faculty Development and Professional Competency Training, are interactively designed as a living educational ecosystem that we will more fully realize our students’ innate potential and contributions in the PH sector.</p>
